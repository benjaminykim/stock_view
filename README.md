# Stock View

A simple, minimal website that allows users to search stock tickers to view financial data pertaining to their stock
choice. This project was built using React, Recharts, [Finnhub API](https://rapidapi.com/Finnhub/api/finnhub-realtime-stock-price/endpoints) and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Check out a live demo [here](https://benjaminykim.github.io/stock_view/).
